### Hi there!

I'm Mauro, a fullstack developer, tech leader, and a passionate advocate for education and social impact.

One of my first work experiences in the tech field was one of the most impactful and transformative experiences I had, at Juventude Digital I was introduced to many good people that had a strong social conscience and extremely competent leaders, that planted a seed in my mind that grew into a passion on making the world a better place and became an advocate of education as a tool to transform lives.

Currently I'm working at the ed-tech [**Woolly**](https://estudecom.woolly.app/) as a tech leader and Fullstack developer. Here I'm working at creating a personalized learning experience that can connect to everyone in Brazil (for now). I'm an advocate of education as a tool to transform lives as I'm myself a witness of the power it has on a person's life. I'm also pursuing a postgraduate degree in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.
